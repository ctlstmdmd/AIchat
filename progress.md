# Progress

- Archived the supplied ZIP and extracted all 12 original Regex JSON files into `legacy/regex-original/`.
- Confirmed the workspace had no `.git` metadata, no existing app source, and no separate selfie/self-description document; the only supplied source artifact was the Regex ZIP.
- Added `docs/LEGACY_ANALYSIS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `EVENT_SCHEMA.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, and `API_PROVIDER.md`.
- Added typed Zod AppEvent schema, replaceable EventStore interface, LegacyParser, and structured/legacy ResponseInterpreter.
- Added Next.js routes for messages, contacts, zone, channels, profile, and settings plus a responsive QQ shell with mock conversations and AI Service placeholder.
- Validation: `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test` pass.
